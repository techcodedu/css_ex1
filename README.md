## Exercise: Design a Blog Page

**Objective**: Design and implement a simple blog page using semantic HTML and CSS, ensuring a visually appealing design.

### Instructions

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Use a semantic structure with the following elements: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer`.
   - Include a blog title in the `header`.
   - The `nav` should contain links to 'Home', 'About', 'Blog', and 'Contact' sections.
   - The `main` should contain at least 3 `articles`. Each `article` should have:
     - A `header` with a blog post title.
     - A `section` with the content of the blog.
     - A `footer` with the author's name and date of publication.
   - The `aside` should have a list of recent posts or categories.
   - The main `footer` should contain copyright information.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Choose a color scheme and apply it consistently across the page.
     - **Hint**: Use the `color` and `background-color` properties. Values can be in hex (e.g., `#FF5733`), RGB, or named colors (e.g., `red`).
   - Style the `nav` links to change color when hovered over.
     - **Hint**: Use the `:hover` pseudo-class in combination with the `color` property.
   - Use different font styles for headings and paragraphs.
     - **Hint**: Use the `font-family` property. Consider using values like `'Arial', sans-serif` or `'Georgia', serif`.
   - Enhance the `aside` with a different background to make it distinct from the main content.
     - **Hint**: Consider using a subtle gradient with the `background-image` property set to a `linear-gradient()` value.

3. **Bonus**:
   - Add images to each blog post.
     - **Hint**: Remember to use the `img` tag in HTML. In CSS, you might want to control its size with the `width` and `height` properties.
   - Implement smooth scrolling when clicking on `nav` links.
     - **Hint**: Use the `scroll-behavior` property and set its value to `smooth`.

### Assessment Criteria:

1. Correct use of semantic HTML elements.
2. Visually appealing design with consistent color scheme and fonts.
3. Bonus features implementation.

### Tips:

- Use tools like [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) for color scheme inspiration.
- Fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) can enhance your design.
- Keep your CSS organized. Consider commenting or grouping by sections (e.g., `/* Header Styles */`).

### Submission:

Once you've completed the exercise, submit the HTML and CSS files for review.
